Generate me a "thorough" fundamental analysis of **${{symbol}}** based on Mark Minervini's SEPA strategy requirements (EPS/Revenue Growth, Net Margins, ROE, Debt/Cash, Catalyst, Exemption, and Forward View).

**Constraint 1: Find the absolute latest available financial data (e.g., latest Quarterly/Annual Report) and market/news data, ensuring the source time is no later than Q2 2025.**

**Constraint 2: For all quantitative criteria (EPS, Revenue, Margins, ROE, Debt/Cash), ensure you report the relevant YoY and/or QoQ growth rates in addition to the raw data, as required by the Minervini strategy (e.g., EPS $X \to Y$ (Z% YoY)).**

**Constraint 3: Explicitly list the "Source" and "Time of Data Source" (Date and Year) for every single criterion.**

**Constraint 4: Use the “Exemption” score only when applicable and provide a clear justification for its use.**

Structure the results in the following exact table format:

| Fundamental Criterion | Minervini requirements | [STOCK\_TICKER]'s Financial Profile | Source | Time of Data Source | SEPA PASS/FAIL | Score (1-10) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Earnings Per Share (EPS) | Strong, accelerating, and positive ($\ge15\%$ YoY, $\ge25\%$ Q/Q) | \[DATA] | \[SOURCE] | \[DATE/YEAR] | \[PASS/FAIL] | \[SCORE] |
| Sales/Revenue Growth | Strong, accelerating ($\ge25\%$ Q/Q) | \[DATA] | \[SOURCE] | \[DATE/YEAR] | \[PASS/FAIL] | \[SCORE] |
| Profit Margins (Net) | Expanding and positive | \[DATA] | \[SOURCE] | \[DATE/YEAR] | \[PASS/FAIL] | \[SCORE] |
| Return on Equity (ROE) | High and/or improving significantly ($\ge17\%$) | \[DATA] | \[SOURCE] | \[DATE/YEAR] | \[PASS/FAIL] | \[SCORE] |
| Debt & Cash Position | Low Debt, Strong Balance Sheet | \[DATA] | \[SOURCE] | \[DATE/YEAR] | \[PASS/FAIL] | \[SCORE] |
| Catalyst | Must have a new product or event driving growth | \[DATA] | \[SOURCE] | \[DATE/YEAR] | \[PASS/FAIL] | \[SCORE] |
| Exemption | Exceptions for Newer/High-Growth | \[DATA] | \[SOURCE] | \[DATE/YEAR] | \[PASS/FAIL] | \[SCORE] |
| Forward View | Anticipation of future growth | \[DATA] | \[SOURCE] | \[DATE/YEAR] | \[PASS/FAIL] | \[SCORE] |

Structure the respose in exact format mentioned below:

**Overall Score (1-10) using appropriate weights**

**Exemption Score if applicable**

**Is passing SEPA due to Exemptions: YES/NO**

**Provide a succinct summary of the observation, highlighting the most recent key data points.**
